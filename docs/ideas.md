# OBUS modules

## Modules

Modules use the standard communication protocol. Extensions in the form of additional message types can be used to request extra information and for configuration.
Only the ID/address should be configured on the modules themselves (with DIP switches or something like that).

## Controller

The controller could have an interface (GUI/CLI/web app) with a control panel and/or scoreboard, to enable competition between different teams.
Spectators could follow along in real time.
The controller could be a Raspberry PI to have easy networking.
