# Spectroscopy Amplifier (model 2020)

Adjust the **coarse gain**, **shaping time** and **input polarity** to find the magic frequency. This is indicated by a green light. The magic frequency is **input polarity** * **coarse gain** * **shaping time**. All frequencies listed below are included in the range.

- If the magic frequency is between 60 and 350, set **RATE** to *AUTO* if **coarse gain** is smaller than 400, otherwise activate **PUR** .

- If the magic frequency is between -145 and 4750, set **MODE** to *SYM*. Otherwise, set **MODE** to *SYM* of **coarse gain** is 100, 300 or 3000. In all other cases, **MODE** should be set to *ASYM*.

- If the magic frequency is smaller than -3000 or higher -1, set **THRESHOLD** to *VAR*.

- If the magic frequency is higher than 4000, disable **PUR**, irregardles of any other rules.

- The default value for all buttons is *HI* or the word with uneven amount of characters.

- If the magic frequency's first digit is even, activate **PUR** if the **shaping time** is 1, 4 or 6.

When the buttons are set, the red light will activate
